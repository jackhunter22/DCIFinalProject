<h1><em>My Disc Golf Journey</em></h1>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>My name is <strong>Jack Hunter</strong>. I am 20 years and go to school in Lexington, Va. Almost 10 years ago, I stumbled across a sport that, even if I didnâ€™t know it, changed my life.
  You can see me about eight years ago in that picture. I have changed a lot since then, but I still like to throw discs around when I can.</p>
  <p>I learned how to play at Camp Rockmont in North Carolina. I went to the camp store, bought a few discs, and was awful.
    I still remember one kid coming up to me and showing me the proper way to throw. I remember very little from when I was 10, but I remember that conversation clearly.</p>

<h1 class="text-center" id="MySummer"> My Summer</h1>
<p>I got to pay it forward in 2021, returning to the same camp to teach kids how to play the sport. Knowing I could make the same impact that that one kid had on me inspired me to be the best teacher I could.
  Over the summer, I led the disc golf skill and spent almost all day on the course with the goal of teaching and inspiring campers.

  <h1>How to Play</h1>
  <p class="pt-4">Disc Golf is similar to Golf in that the gist of the game is to have as few shots as possible through 18 holes. Each hole is a unique challenge that a player tries to conquer in as few strokes as possible.
    In Disc Golf, however, players throw golf discs until they can throw it into a metal basket, with chains to catch the disc.
  </p>
  <p>Golf discs are different than ultimate frisbees. They are smaller and often lighter, but the biggest difference is a sharper edge, which makes golf discs much more aerodynamic. You should not try and play catch with them.
    Players use three types of discs: drivers, mid-ranges, and putters.  
  </p>
  <p>Putters have the rounder edges, making them slower and more controllable. They are good for approach shots and putting.
    Mid-ranges have a sharper edge than putters but still have a rounder edge than drivers. They will turn and fade more but will also fly faster if given more force.
    Drivers have sharp edges that cut through the air to allow players to throw long shots. These discs are harder to control and can fade hard if not thrown hard enough.
  </p>
  <p>Each disc has unique characteristics that make them valuable. Players care about how fast the disc will fly, which direction will it go (left/right), and whether it will glide in the air or push itself down. </p>
